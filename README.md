# Digital Library Organizer

## Project Purpose
The **Digital Library Organizer** is a mini PHP system that simulates a digital library. The project is designed to help students learn and apply fundamental data structures and algorithms in PHP:

- **Recursion**: To navigate and display hierarchical book categories.
- **Hash Tables (Associative Arrays)**: To store and retrieve book metadata efficiently.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: To organize and search books alphabetically by title.

This project strengthens problem-solving, logical thinking, and algorithmic skills in PHP programming.

## How to Run Each Part

### 1. Recursive Directory Display (`recursion.php`)
- **Purpose**: Display book categories and books in a hierarchical format using recursion.
- **How to Run**:  
  1. Open `recursion.php` in your browser via XAMPP:  
     ```

     ```
  2. The script will print all categories and books with proper indentation.

### 2. Hash Table for Book Details (`hashtable.php`)
- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve book metadata using PHP associative arrays.
- **How to Run**:  
  1. Open `hashtable.php` in your browser:  
     ```
   
     ```
  2. Enter a book title in the code or via input (if implemented) to display its details.

### 3. Binary Search Tree (BST) for Book Titles (`bst.php`)
- **Purpose**: Organize books alphabetically and search efficiently using a BST.
- **How to Run**:  
  1. Open `bst.php` in your browser:  
     ```
     
     ```
  2. The script will demonstrate:
     - Searching for a book title
     - Displaying all books in alphabetical order

### 4. Integrated Version (`main.php`)
- **Purpose**: Combine recursion, hash tables, and BST to create a full digital library simulation.
- **How to Run**:  
  1. Open `main.php` in your browser:  
     ```
  
     ```
  2. The page will show:
     - Library categories (recursive display)
     - Book details (hash table)
     - Alphabetical listing and search (BST)
